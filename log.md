# Central Log

## Sep 1st
  * Austin Kleon's _Steal Like An Artist_
  	* inspired me to start logging/journaling again
  	* also to do 100Days in the open & under my terms – not limited to coding, but to see it as my craft

## Sep 2nd
  * TypeScript in 50 Lessons [[🔗 Book](https://typescript-book.com/) | [📝 Notes](ts-in-50-lessons/ch1.md)]
  * it's always interesting to me to get back to the fundamentals

## Sep 3rd
  * TypeScript in 50 Lessons [[🔗 Book](https://typescript-book.com/) | [📝 Notes](ts-in-50-lessons/ch1.md)]
  * with me being a more visual/practical person, I get why my way of communicating/thinking could lead to misunderstanding my abilities

## Sep 4th
 * motivation was low due to a long/energy-demanding day
 * TypeScript in 50 lessons:
  * tried to set up exercise/sample project, but got stuck somehow -> decided to let it go for now & keep moving forward
  * reset timer to 25% of total time to read through chapter 2 – lessons 8, 9, 10 without making notes 👍 – baby steps today

## Sep 5th
 🤧 sick day

## Sep 6th
 * still not feeling on top of things, so a light hour of reading 🤓
 * Austin Kleon's _Show Your Work_
  * aimed at artists, but actually useful to anyone who wants to improve their visibility
  * reminds me of the way I found my way into tech
  * reflecting how I see coding as a craft/art more than.. I don't know.. a sport?
 * finished TypeScript in 50 Lessons Chapter 2, but still without notes, will come back to it
