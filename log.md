# Central Log

## Sep 1st
  * Austin Kleon's Steal Like An Artist
  	* inspired me to start logging/journaling again
  	* also to do 100Days in the open & under my terms – not limited to coding, but to see it as my craft

## Sep 2nd
  * TypeScript in 50 Lessons [[🔗 Book](https://typescript-book.com/) | [📝 Notes](ts-in-50-lessons/ch1.md)]
  * it's always interesting to me to get back to the fundamentals

## Sep 3rd
  * TypeScript in 50 Lessons [[🔗 Book](https://typescript-book.com/) | [📝 Notes](ts-in-50-lessons/ch1.md)]
  * with me being a more visual/practical person, I get why my way of communicating/thinking could lead to misunderstanding my abilities

### Sep 4th
 * motivation was low due to a long/energy-demanding day
 * tried to set up exercise/sample project, but got stuck somehow -> decided to let it go for now & keep moving forward
 * reset timer to 25% of total time to read through chapter 2 – lessons 8, 9, 10 without making notes 👍 – baby steps today
